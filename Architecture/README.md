## Architecture application

The Electronic Journal for School application is focused on simplifying interaction between pupils, teachers, parents and administrators. The application architecture includes client and server parts, as well as a data management system using PostgreSQL and Liquibase for migrations.
## The overall structure of the application
## The application consists of several layers:
- **Client part (Frontend): a mobile application on React Native.**
- **Server part (Backend): REST API based on Spring Boot.**
- **Database: PostgreSQL relational database.**
- **Infrastructure: using Liquibase for database migration and JWT for user authentication and authorization.**
